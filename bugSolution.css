The issue can be resolved by restructuring the CSS to rely less on `!important`. Instead of using `!important`, we leverage specificity to achieve the desired styling:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

/* Alternatively, for better readability and maintainability, use a more specific class name */
.parent .child-green {
  color: green;
}
```

This version achieves the same visual result without the `!important` declaration, making the CSS more predictable and maintainable.
